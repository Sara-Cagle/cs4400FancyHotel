<h1>Selection Page View</h1><br /><br />

<p>Here we can select what we want to do. The main page after login</p>
<p>This will likely have two different views itself based on who is logged in, the manager or customer</p>
<p>Or maybe just have two views but they're toggled by a customer/manager variable?</p>

<p>But that's not secure--do we need to implement security?</p>

<h1>Hello {{currentUser}} ! <br />
<h1>You are a {{userType}}!</h1>
